md"# Letting the computer do science

Let's think a little... What do you think is the process by which scientific discoveries are made? 

First, you have some situation or event of interest from which you want to discover the rules that govern it. Second, you carefully design the experiments to get as much unbiased data as you can. Third, you analyze that data to gain some knowledge and, hopefully, you can begin to write some equations that condense the underling process. Finally, you keep doing experiments to confirm that the equations you have invented are correct. You are doing science, my friend!

Throughout the book, we were learning a wide variety of statistical methods that sought to be as general as possible, but that required us to define the model to be used... The equations, then, were already defined and the algorithm only had to find the best parameters (or distribution of them) to fit that model to the data.
